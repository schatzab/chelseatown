			Chelsea is an excellent designer and coder. She has worked on many projects for me over the years
			 and is a joy to work with. Not only was she able to produce high quality work with a great 
			attitude, but she is able to contribute in multiple areas to produce a great product including UI, UX, and software engineering. 
			I highly recommend her.

			I've worked with Chelsea for close to three years. During this time, she has proven her proficiency in multiple areas including web
			 development, UX, software testing and anything thrown her way, really. She is an incredibly quick learner and adept at explaining 
			technical concepts to non technical audiences. Chelsea was a joy to work with and would be a valuable asset to any organization.

			Chelsea is a strong performer with a broad set of skills. Chelsea and I worked closely together in a start up environment on 
			a variety of projects. She has the ability to be detailed and specific, but is also able to design and implement strategy. 
			This combination is very powerful, especially when combined with great communication skills. Chelsea is an asset to any business.

			Kudos to Chelsea's solid QA.  It's harder to get an app past her than apple, she finds all my bugs ;-)
