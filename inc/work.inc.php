				<h1>Client Success and Technology</h1>
				<div class="work_main_box_text">
				Over a span of 20 years, my professional career has centered around client success and technology. With a variety of skills I’ve utilized my understanding of web development and clean user interfaces to help business and individual accounts alike find their desired goals. With education in writing and editing, I’ve gained a knack for explaining technology and software to clients through documentation and communications. Solid skills in the Adobe Suite and mockup software have allowed me to further help people, websites and informational documents through visual cues. Lastly, organization has been the key to my success with deadlines, priorities, budgets, and overall client happiness.  Using a wide array of tools I’ve found help for myself and those I work with.

				<br><br>
				My portfolio includes Marketing, Client Management, QA Testing, User Experience, Design and Front End development. Over the last several years I've also grown to include CAD and CAM to my skill set, using CNC machining to build products for businesses. <i>My goal is to always keep learning!</i>

					Keeping up to date with market trends and modern web developments has allowed me to create sleek, up-to-date websites and promotional material. I am very familiar with the Adobe Suite software as my implementation tools and am always keeping an eye out for new inspirations. My design background and eye for spacial balance has given me a strong feel for how to develop a positive user experience.
					<br><br>
					My mediums are websites, applications, written copy, videos, voice-overs, magazines, newspapers, signs, and various swag. My experience includes implementing these tools with project management, and client interactions where we team build solid advertising, lead-generation and business campaigns.

				<h1>Work Culture & Education</h1>
				<div class="work_main_box_text">
					I’ve participated in hiring and interviewing and believe that the best team is composed of educated, moral individuals who are self-motivated, reliable, skilled and have the ability to express themselves well to others. In addition to this, a care for co-workers is imperative for a team to move forward as a whole.
					<br><br>
					My degree is in Computer Graphics and much of my software education has been self taught and maintained. I've greatly benefited from the wealth of knowledge others have taught on the Internet, and am thankful to them! Online teachers have included e-books, Internet tutorials, blogs, online courses, hundreds of tutorial videos and exercises, and a variety of go-to tech news sites to keep up-to-date on technology.
