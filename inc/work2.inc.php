				<h1>Software Engineering</h1>
				<div class="work_main_box_text">
					I’m a female coder who loves to get her coding-nerd on, cheers when tough scripts work, and destroys with a vengeance when bugs appear.  My passion is coding and creating user friendly software.
					<br><br>
					For the last five years I've worked as the Front End Developer of a small startup company and sole tester of all products and applications. I wrote the code using Sublime Text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, working in and out of the backend code and giving support for the company’s API, GitHub command prompt, WordPress technical support, Apple and Google application implementation and testing, working with Customer Support to offer technical assistance to clients, and developed tutorial videos with my own voiceovers. On my own time I’ve taught myself PHP, AngularJS, Sass, Ruby on Rails, server setup and deployment and MySQL/PostgreSQL databases.

			<h1>Design UI/UX</h1>
			<div class="work_main_box_text_whitebg">
					Design is something I was formally educated in at UCSB, but I also believe it is a growing entity which changes and, hopefully, improves over time. I am quite skilled at the Adobe suite of software as my implementation tools and am always keeping an eye out for new inspirations and trends.
					<br><br>
					Since 1996 I've been teaching myself how to write code for the web, learn new technologies, as well as create my own designs and develop with UI/UX in mind.  In previous jobs I’ve created the color scheme, icons, informational graphics, landing pages, support pages, and worked with Marketing for a strong UI/UX interface, including A/B testing.

				<h1>Work Culture & Education</h1>
				<div class="work_main_box_text">
					I’ve done my share of hiring and interviewing and believe that the best team is composed of quality, moral individuals who get along with each other, have the ability to direct themselves and ideally have a strong innate technical knowledge and troubleshooting abilities. But the one I prize quite highly is the desire for continuing education and the pull to keep learning.
					<br><br>
 					My University degree is in Computer Graphics and my software development education has all been self taught. My online teachers have included trial and error, e-books, W3Schools Online, many various Internet tutorials, Stack Overflow, CSS-Tricks, Sitepoint, e-courses, hundreds of tutorial videos and exercises, and a variety of go-to tech news sites.
