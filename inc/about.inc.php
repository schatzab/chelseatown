				Raised on the island of O'ahu, I grew up an island girl until I moved to California where I received my Bachelor's degree at UCSB. I continued, educating myself with experience and trial & error. Bend, Oregon is now my home with my adventure-loving family of four. Hiking, skateboarding, skiing, running and enjoying this amazing state are some of the things we do whenever time allows. I believe in learning as a lifelong journey and try to absorb as much as I can through books and what's shared on the Internet.

				My goals are to work with a company which enjoys change, strives for common goals, treats each other with (and expects) respect, and aims for progressive development. My skills are technology-based and I'm a quick learner with many interests. If you'd like to get into specifics, I'm glad to chat more about them!
