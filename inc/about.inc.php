				I was raised on the island of O'ahu, then educated at UCSB and the school of life. Bend, Oregon is now my home with my adventure-loving family of four. I believe in learning as a life-long journey and try to absorb as much as I can.  My goals are to work with a company which enjoys change and working towards progressive development.  

				<br><br>
				My skills are technology-based and I'm a quick learner with many interests. If you'd like specifics, I'm glad to chat more about them!
